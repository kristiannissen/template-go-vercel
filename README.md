# template-go-vercel
Template to get started with Go / Golang on Vercel for free!

I created this repo because I found Vercel's documentation quit limited and the repo made by [@riccardogiorato](https://github.com/riccardogiorato/template-go-vercel) also not really providing me with answers to the questions I had about how to get started with Go / Golang on Vercel.
